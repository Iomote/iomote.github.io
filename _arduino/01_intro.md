X400 supports standard Arduino commands (for ex. `digitalWrite`) and specific commands available on the **Iomote X400 library**.
The Iomote library allows pin-level operations (for ex. `Iomote.AnalogRead`) and it allows to send data messages and notifications to the Cloud.

In the next chapters you will learn each specific command available on the Iomote library.
