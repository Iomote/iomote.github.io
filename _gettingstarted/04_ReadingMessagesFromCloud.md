Once the app is up and running on the device, you can read the incoming data accessing directly the service bus. Microsoft has released libraries in several programming languages, on the Iomote Git Hub account you can find example for [**NodeJS**](https://github.com/Iomote/iomote-sb-nodejs) and [**C# (.NET Core)**](https://github.com/Iomote/iomote-sb-dotnetcore). Both applications are very basic example of usage, reading the data from the service bus and writing it back on the terminal. They can be used as starting point for your application, to redirect data to your azure services or to store it inside your database.
